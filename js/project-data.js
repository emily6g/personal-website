    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>Problem</h4>
      <p>Many food related games focus on fast food or unrealistic eating habits, which can reinforce unhealthy ideas. We wanted to address this gap by creating a game that was both entertaining and educational. The goal was to encourage players to think about balanced eating in a way that felt fun, accessible, and engaging for all ages.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>Users</h4>
      <p>Munch Match was designed for a wide audience, including kids learning about nutrition, parents who want educational games for their children, and adults looking for casual but meaningful gameplay. The core users are people who enjoy tile matching games but also want an added educational element. By combining fun mechanics with nutrition awareness, the game reaches both casual gamers and those interested in healthier living.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>We created Munch Match, a food themed tile matching game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each tile features a variety of foods from different groups, prompting players to explore food diversity while playing. The game blends memory challenges with educational content, reinforcing the idea of balanced eating habits through fun, colorful visuals and smooth interactivity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>My Role</h4>
      <p>I contributed to both the design and development of Munch Match. I worked on the frontend structure and styling with HTML and CSS, ensuring the game was responsive and user friendly across devices. I also implemented the JavaScript logic that powered the tile matching system, debugged gameplay issues, and refined the visuals to make food tiles clear and engaging.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>Metrics</h4>
      <p>Munch Match stood out at the Build4Good Hackathon, where it earned 3rd place and was recognized for UI/UX excellence among 50+ teams. Players responded positively to the clean design, smooth gameplay, and unique educational value. The project also highlighted the potential of combining game mechanics with nutrition awareness, demonstrating adoption and engagement beyond traditional casual games.</p>

    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>Problem</h4>
      <p>Every semester, Texas A&M students face challenges in navigating course selection, finding study spaces, and choosing where to eat on campus. Information is scattered across multiple sources, often outdated, and rarely personalized. This lack of reliable guidance creates unnecessary stress and wasted time for students trying to make informed decisions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>Users</h4>
      <p>Our primary users were Texas A&M students, especially freshmen and those unfamiliar with campus resources. They needed a centralized tool that could simplify decision making for classes, dining, and study spaces. By providing real time and student driven insights, Maroon Recs served students looking for a more efficient and stress free way to manage daily academic life.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>We built Maroon Recs, a recommendation platform that ranks professors, dining options, and study spots while showing real time status updates like whether a location is open or closed. The website provided curated information to reduce the guesswork of everyday student decisions. With a clean and functional interface, it transformed scattered resources into one centralized, easy to use platform.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>My Role</h4>
      <p>I contributed to both the product vision and development. I helped design the layout using Canva, collaborated on pseudocode planning in Google Docs, and translated the design into code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also worked on refining the UI, resolving GitHub merge conflicts, and integrating frontend and backend features to ensure the platform functioned seamlessly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>Metrics</h4>
      <p>Maroon Recs was successfully demoed at TAMUHack, gaining recognition for its relevance to student life and practical design. Users appreciated the real time updates and clean interface, which simplified otherwise stressful decisions. The project demonstrated strong engagement potential and laid the groundwork for future features like dorm rankings and off campus living recommendations.</p>

    "A Texas A&M themed twist on the classic Wordle game. Players can choose from four categories, each offering unique word challenges tied to Aggie life and culture. It’s a fun way for students to test their knowledge, celebrate traditions, and bring a bit of Aggie spirit into their daily Wordle routine.",

    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>Problem</h4>
      <p>Wordle was a viral game, but Aggies didn’t have a version that reflected their campus culture. Many students played daily, yet there wasn’t a way to tie this habit to Texas A&M pride. The lack of a themed game left a gap for community driven engagement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>Users</h4>
      <p>Our main users were Texas A&M students who already loved Wordle and wanted a fun, campus themed twist. Alumni and fans of Aggie traditions were secondary users who appreciated the nostalgia and challenge. Both groups benefited from a shared way to connect through play.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>Solution</h4>
      <p>We built BTHO Wordle, an Aggie themed Wordle with four unique categories: Tamu Unlimited, Tamu Wordle, Wild West, and Majors. The game included Aggie branding, music, and custom visuals, such as celebratory Reveille or snake pop ups. This design gave players variety, humor, and a sense of campus identity while playing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>My Role</h4>
      <p>I guided product decisions on categories and game flow, making sure the design aligned with Aggie culture. I researched Wordle mechanics and adapted them for themed word sets. On the technical side, I developed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript pages, integrated audio, and handled visual design tradeoffs to ensure a working MVP.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="cs-block">
      <h4>Metrics</h4>
      <p>We saw strong engagement from students who tested the game at TAMUHack and enjoyed replaying different categories. "Tamu Unlimited” especially sparked playful competition among peers, encouraging multiple play sessions. The project gave us recognition for creativity, plus measurable growth in our ability to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript effectively.</p>
